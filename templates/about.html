    <h2>What is LookAtThat?</h2>
    <p class="lead">At its core, LookAtThat is an image curation application powered by the Flickr API. 
        Picture this: You're looking to introduce someone to the diverse array of animals found in a zoo. 
        With our platform, you can effortlessly compile lists of these magnificent creatures, complete with 
        vivid images, and then dive into interactive slideshows or quizzes to enrich the learning experience.</p>

        <a href="{{ url_for('user_routes.reg_log') }}">log in</a>, you will have full access 
        to LookAtThat. We've got your back with some pre-crafted lists to get you started, in particular the Dolch sight-word lists
        are a seminal aspect of what we've tried to present here.</p>
